## About Me

Howdy! I'm Priyasha Shrivastava, a self-proclaimed Developer with a knack for turning coffee into Passion. When not wrestling with code, you can find me gaming, or trying to decode the behaviour of my dog.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently juggling

- NFT Marketplace - Buy, Sell, List NFTs with just one click
  
## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

- Solidity - Trying to speak the language of robots more fluently.
- React - Unraveling the mysteries of the latest tech trends.
- Javascript - Adding more colours to my coding palette.

## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on

Open to collaborating on projects that involve Frontend and Blockchain, preferably ones that don't require sacrificing too many cups of coffee. If you have a project that needs a touch of wit and a lot of caffeine-fueled enthusiasm, count me in!

## ðŸ“« How to reach me

You can reach out to me via tashishrivastava77249@gmail.com, carrier pigeon, or just shout my name three times in front of a mirror. You can also stalk me on https://instagram.com/tashishrivastav?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA== if that's your thing.

## âš¡ Fun fact

I firmly believe that the best code is written between 1 AM and 4 AM. Also, I can recite the entire script of Lord of the Rings from memory.


Feel free to dive into my coding adventures and shenanigans. If you need a laugh or have a project that needs some wit, drop me a line! Cheers!
